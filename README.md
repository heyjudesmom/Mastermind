# Mastermind
 Mastermind is a game of **deduction**. Crack the secret color code in ten or fewer attempts to win the game. 


 Mastermind was invented by Mordechai Meirovitz in 1970 as a two player board game, though the game is known to be based on a similar pen and paper game named *Cows and Bulls*, that dates back to the late 1800s.
